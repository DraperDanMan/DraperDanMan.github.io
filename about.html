I'm Daniel **Draps** Draper, a game developer from Melbourne, Australia. Currently
working at ['Samuri Punk'](https://samuraipunk.com/) on lots of rad and cheeky projects.
<br/>
While there I've worked on:

* ['The American Dream VR'](https://samuraipunk.com/the-american-dream), a satirical 
virtual reality trip through a 1950’s world’s fair where you learn to live your life with guns.
* ['Feather'](https://samuraipunk.com/feather), a serene game about exploration and 
immersion in a beautiful landscape.
* ['Screencheat: Unplugged'](https://samuraipunk.com/screencheat-unplugged), a multiplayer split-screen shooter 
where everyone is invisible, so you have to... well... screencheat.

I used to run a YouTube channel called [DrapsTV](https://www.youtube.com/drapstv) a channel dedicated to computer science, 
mostly programming and hacking with python. Currently abandoned.

In my free time I spend time working on a custom vulkan rendering engine called Carbon (though not really commited to the name yet). 
I also love to participate in game jams such as Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare jams. 

This blog is totally a work in progress..

**Thank you for stopping by!**.
